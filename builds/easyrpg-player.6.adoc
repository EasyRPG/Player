== NAME
easyrpg-player - Interpreter for RPG Maker 2000/2003 games


== SYNOPSIS
*easyrpg-player* [<optional flags>...]


== DESCRIPTION
EasyRPG Player is an open source interpreter for RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games.
It aims to support all features of unmodified games and also has some support
for some additional binary patches.


== OPTIONS
*--battle-test* 'MONSTERPARTY'::
  Starts a battle test with the specified monster party.

*--disable-audio*::
  Disable audio (in case you prefer your own music).

*--disable-rtp*::
  Disable support for the Runtime Package (RTP).

*--encoding* 'ENCODING'::
  Instead of auto detecting the encoding or using the one in RPG_RT.ini, the
  specified encoding is used. Use "auto" for automatic detection.

*--engine* 'ENGINE'::
  Disable auto detection of the simulated engine. Possible options:
   - 'rpg2k'   - RPG Maker 2000 engine
   - 'rpg2k3'  - RPG Maker 2003 engine
   - 'rpg2k3e' - RPG Maker 2003 (English release) engine

*--fullscreen*::
  Start in fullscreen mode.

*--show-fps*::
  Enable frames per second counter.

*--hide-title*::
  Hide the title background image and center the command menu.

*--load-game-id* 'ID'::
  Skip the title scene and load Save__ID__.lsd ('ID' is padded to two digits).

*--new-game*::
  Skip the title scene and start a new game directly.

*--project-path* 'PATH'::
  Instead of using the working directory the game in 'PATH' is used.

*--save-path* 'PATH'::
  Instead of storing save files in the game directory they are stored in
  'PATH'. The directory must exist.

NOTE: When using the game browser all games will share the same save
directory!

*--seed* 'SEED'::
  Seeds the random number generator.

*--start-map-id* 'ID'::
  Overwrite the map used for new games and use Map__ID__.lmu instead ('ID' is
  padded to four digits).

NOTE: Incompatible with *--load-game-id*.

*--start-position* 'X' 'Y'::
  Overwrite the party start position and move the party to position ('X', 'Y').

NOTE: Incompatible with *--load-game-id*.

*--start-party* 'A' ['B' '...']::
  Overwrite the starting party members with the actors with IDs 'A', 'B', '...'

NOTE: Incompatible with *--load-game-id*.

*--test-play*::
  Enable TestPlay mode.

*--window*::
  Start in window mode.

*-v*, *--version*::
  Display program version and exit.

*-h*, *--help*::
  Display help and exit.

For compatibility with the original RPG Maker runtime the following legacy
arguments are supported:

*BattleTest* 'ID'::
  Same as *--battle-test*. When 'ID' is not a valid number the 4th argument is
  used as the party id.

*HideTitle*::
  Same as *--hide-title*.

*TestPlay*::
  Same as *--test-play*.

*Window*::
  Same as *--window*.


== ENVIRONMENT
'RPG2K_RTP_PATH'::
  Full path to a folder containing the extracted RPG Maker 2000
  Run-Time-Package(RTP).

'RPG2K3_RTP_PATH'::
  Full path to a folder containing the extracted RPG Maker 2003
  Run-Time-Package(RTP).

'RPG_RTP_PATH'::
  Full path to a folder containing both RTPs.


== FILES
'RPG_RT.ini'::
  The game configuration file. It follows a simple *Key*='Value' syntax in
  multiple sections. Specific options can be set in the [EasyRPG] section.
  For example:
----
[EasyRPG]
Encoding=1252
----
  This will set the correct encoding for most english games.

NOTE: Values in the configuration file will overwrite auto detected ones,
however command line parameters will take precedence.
